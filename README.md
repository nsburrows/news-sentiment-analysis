# News Sentiment Analysis

Formerly World101, now News Sentiment Analysis because an NSA app just sounds so cool.

My first go at an actual project, hope you like it. I made it as a result of me wanting to read
better news, not always reading something negative, to be able to find positive news in all the goes
on in the world. I have big ambitions for this app, but this is just the start (mostly due to that darn
5k limit lol)

## Instructions

Make sure you have an good internet connection and an Android device (Have not tested iOS)

It's pretty simple just open the app and find a news article you like (they are sorted by magnitude descending).
Articles highlighted in green have a positive sentiment score, and ones highlighted in red have a negative sentiemnt score
Articles that had a sentiment score of 0 were left unhighligted. You will see sentiment scores at the lwoer right of articles

You can also drag from the top to refresh the page.

If you click on an article it will take you to a webviewer where you can read the article and share it with others
